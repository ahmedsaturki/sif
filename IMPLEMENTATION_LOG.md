# SIF Implementation Log

## Baseline Sequence

| Stage | Main addition | Verification |
|---|---|---|
| 0.0.0 | Empty repository / architecture genesis | repository state inspected |
| 0.1.0 | Core contracts, event store, replay, registries, authority, execution gates | build + tests |
| 0.2.0 | Integrity, CAS, attestations, policy, durable outbox | integration tests |
| 0.3.0 | PostgreSQL transactional adapter | typed transaction contract tests |
| 0.4.0 | Stream-head serialization, checkpoints, leases, inbox/idempotency | expanded integration tests |
| 0.5.0 | Workers, durable processing and restart-safe primitives | 27/27 tests PASS |

## Critical Fixes

### Stream Concurrency
A design based only on `MAX(stream_version)` was insufficient as a serialization primitive. The PostgreSQL schema therefore uses a dedicated `sif_stream_heads` row and `FOR UPDATE` locking for per-stream append serialization.

### Policy Semantics
Deny rules override matching allow rules. Policy defaults to deny when no explicit allow applies.

### Outbox Semantics
Durable delivery is at-least-once. Exactly-once external effects are intentionally not claimed.

### Worker Leasing
Leases have owners, expirations and reclaim behavior. A stale worker cannot complete work after its lease is lost.

### Inbox Idempotency
Consumer-side event identity is persisted so duplicate delivery does not imply duplicate committed handling.

## Evidence Discipline

The project records what was actually run and separates local unit/integration contract verification, live infrastructure verification, and future integration requirements.

Unknown infrastructure is never represented as verified implementation.

## 0.6 Live PostgreSQL Milestone

- Added dependency-free PostgreSQL wire-protocol integration harness.
- Added real PostgreSQL 16 service to GitHub Actions.
- Verified concurrent same-stream transactional serialization.
- Verified atomic rollback across event, stream head, and outbox on constraint failure.
- Verified durable projection checkpoint persistence and deterministic round-trip.
- Verified outbox lease exclusivity, expiry/reclaim, stale-owner fencing, and successful current-owner delivery.
- Added direct PostgreSQL crash-window characterization for before-commit and after-commit termination windows.
- Detected and fixed nondeterministic assumptions in the live outbox test; final verification uses one destination and deterministic sequencing.
- Detected and fixed SQL syntax in crash-window verification queries.
- GitHub Actions run 169 passed final verified candidate build, unit tests, schema bootstrap, 4/4 live PostgreSQL scenarios, and crash-window characterization on code candidate `3f1a248b226122696dd612cd7740e3c851c9a31f`.
- Reconciled README, 360° state, verification matrix, architecture, roadmap, implementation status, and release evidence with the verified final implementation evidence.

### Final verification state

The implementation-level 0.6 persistence milestone is verified on real PostgreSQL 16.15 for code candidate `3f1a248b226122696dd612cd7740e3c851c9a31f`. Documentation-only reconciliation commits after that verification do not change the implementation behavior; they require fresh CI before the documentation-updated branch is treated as the final candidate.

### Release Boundary

A future `0.6.0` artifact release requires fresh artifacts built from the promotion commit, SHA-256 identities, byte-preserving preservation, and independent verification. CI success does not imply merge or binary publication.
